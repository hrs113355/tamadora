# tamadora

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/hrs113355/tamadora.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/hrs113355/tamadora)

tamadora is a chat bot built on the [Hubot][hubot] framework. It was
initially generated by [generator-hubot][generator-hubot], and configured to be
deployed on [Heroku][heroku] to get you up and running as quick as possible.

This README is intended to help get you started. Definitely update and improve
to talk about your own instance, how to use and deploy, what functionality he
has, etc!

##  Persistence

If you are going to use the `hubot-redis-brain` package (strongly suggested),
you will need to add the Redis to Go addon on Heroku which requires a verified
account or you can create an account at [Redis to Go][redistogo] and manually
set the `REDISTOGO_URL` variable.

    % heroku config:add REDISTOGO_URL="..."

If you don't need any persistence feel free to remove the `hubot-redis-brain`
from `external-scripts.json` and you don't need to worry about redis at all.

#### Deploying to Heroku

This is a modified set of instructions based on the [instructions on the Hubot wiki](https://github.com/github/hubot/blob/master/docs/deploying/heroku.md).

- Follow the instructions above to create a hubot locally
- Edit your `Procfile` and change it to use the `slack` adapter:

        web: bin/hubot --adapter slack

- Install [heroku toolbelt](https://toolbelt.heroku.com/) if you haven't already.
- `heroku create my-company-slackbot`
- `heroku addons:add redistogo:nano`
- Activate the Hubot service on your ["Team Services"](http://my.slack.com/services/new/hubot) page inside Slack.
- Add the [config variables](#adapter-configuration). For example:

        % heroku config:add HEROKU_URL=https://my-company-slackbot.herokuapp.com
        % heroku config:add HUBOT_SLACK_TOKEN=xoxb-1234-5678-91011-00e4dd

- Deploy and start the bot:

        % git push heroku master
        % heroku ps:scale web=1

- Profit!

## Restart the bot

You may want to get comfortable with `heroku logs` and `heroku restart` if
you're having issues.
